                <h1>Research</h2><br>
                    Can we discover general principles of animal behavior? Are humans and non-human animals subject to the same principles? These are some questions that make me stay up late to investigate the frontiers of human knowledge. <br><br>
                    I started my research career studying chaotic dynamical systems inspired by exciting advances in the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model">biophysical neuronal models</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_decision-making">decision making</a>.<br><br>
                    I currently work with two different projects: <br><br> 
                    The first one is related how the brain represents the passage of time. I developed a computational model based on a sequentially-activated network to understand how the brain responds during time-related tasks. The goal was to approximate different abstract timing models to a biological framework. I predicted the behavioral responses of rats performing a timing task, including a central behavioral property in timing, the Weber law. The law states that the variation of timing estimates is proportional to the time being estimated. In the project, I gained experience with mathematical models in concrete behavioral data and developed my programming skills in Python and MATLAB.<br><br>
                    The second one studies a fundamental principle applied to vocal development. More specifically, the project helps us understand the physical constraints that drive vocal development. I used extensive data from my laboratory together with open access vocal data from different species to test a stochastic dynamical model and concluded that both the energy required to vocalize and the information transmitted by the vocalization drives the vocal development process. I was able to make new predictions on what changes occur during vocal development as a function of different contexts (e.g., more or less contingent parental feedback). The project allowed me to develop many skills in statistical methods, such as principal component analysis and bootstrapping. <br><br>
