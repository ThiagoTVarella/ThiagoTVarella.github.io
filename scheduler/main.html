    <h2> Scheduler </h2>
    <p id="mainp"> Hi! Thanks for maybe using this scheduler. The current intended use of this website is to provide a schedule for interviews between students and professors, given that students have preferred professors to have the interview with, and professors have specific time availabilities. The timeslots are enumerated from 1 to the number of timeslots.</p>

    <!-- Create hyperlink to manualinput.html -->
    If you already have all the data of the preferences for each student and availability for each professor, 
    <a href="manualinput.html">click here to enter that data manually.</a>
    <br><br>
    If you haven't yet conducted the survey of the student preferred interviewers and professor's availability,
    <!-- Create hyperlink to automaticinput.html -->
    <a href="automaticinput.html">click here for instructions on how to proceed.</a>

    <p id="mainp"> If you are a company/a department/an organization, consider reaching out to Thiago T. Varella to contribute financially before using it! Thank you â™¥ </p>
